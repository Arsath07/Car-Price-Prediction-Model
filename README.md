# Car-Price-Prediction-Model
This model will estimate a selling price of a car based on the year it was bought and how many kilometers it was driven. The model is trained with dataset which I found in kaggle ( I uploaded dataset in this repository, so you can use that)  

The model is trained with Multivariable Linear Regressin Algorithm. In this code, Linear Regression is implemented from absolute scratch with help of some useful python libraries.
